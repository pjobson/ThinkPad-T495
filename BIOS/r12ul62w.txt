UPDATING THE UEFI BIOS

Note for Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS:
  See "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Debian 9.3.0:
  Debian 9.3.0 does not include fwupd package which is required to update
  firmware by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupd package. After you installed fwupd package,
  see "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.5:
  Red Hat Linux Enterprise 7.5 does not include fwupd package
  which is required to update firmware by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupd package. After you installed fwupd package,
  see "Manual Update Using fwupdmgr" section for instruction.

IMPORTANT NOTE for Suse Linux Enterprise 12 SP3:
  No fwupd package is available for Suse Linux Enterprise 12 SP3.
  You need to use "fwupdate" command instead, a lower-layer frontend,
  which is not included by default.
  Please check with your distribution vendor contact how to install
  fwupdate package. See "Manual Update Using fwupdate" section.


Notes:
- If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to update
  the UEFI BIOS. To determine if you should update the UEFI BIOS, refer to the
  Version Information section.
- You need an AC adapter and a charged battery pack.
- Remove the Power-on password prior to updating the UEFI BIOS in the remote
  deployment environments.


Attention:
  Do not turn off or suspend the computer until the update has been completed.
  IF YOU DO THAT WHILE THE UPDATE IS STILL IN PROGRESS, THE SYSTEM BOARD MAY
  HAVE TO BE REPLACED.


Manual Update Using fwupdmgr

  1. Make sure the AC adapter is firmly connected to the target computer.
  2. Launch Terminal.
  3. Move to the directory where the cabinet file was placed.
  4. Run fwupdmgr to schedule firmware update.

        # fwupdmgr install xxx.cab

  5. Restart the system.
     You may be able to use "reboot" command.
     If it is not available, select "Reboot" from Power icon on the desktop.
  6. The computer will be restarted and the EFI BIOS will be updated.


Manual Update Using fwupdate

  Superuser privilege is required during the instruction.

  1. Make sure the AC adapter is firmly connected to the target computer.
  2. Launch Files application on GNOME desktop.
  3. Locate the directory where the cabinet file was placed.
  4. Right-click the cabinet file, select Extract Here.
  5. Launch Terminal.
  6. Move to the directory where the contents of the cabinet file was extracted.
  7. Check GUID of System Firmware

        # su
        # fwupdate -l

     "fwupdate -l" lists GUIDs as follows.
     Check a GUID which is marked as System Firmware type.

        System Firmware Type, {xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx} version XXX can be updated to any version above XXX
        Device Firmware Type, {yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy} version YYY can be updated to any version above YYY
        Device Firmware Type, {zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz} version ZZZ can be updated to any version above ZZZ

  8. Run fwupdate with the GUID obtained in the Step.7.
     If fwupdate succeeds to schedule firmware update, it finishes silently without any message.

        # su
        # fwupdate -a xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx firmware.bin

  9. Restart the system.
     You may be able to use "reboot" command.
     If it is not available, select "Reboot" from Power icon on the desktop.
 10. The computer will be restarted and the EFI BIOS will be updated.
 11. Finally delete the files extracted in the Step.4.
